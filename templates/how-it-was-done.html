                We will try to describe the steps as non-technical as possible.<br>
                For those who are interested in more details or want to see the code itself, the entire project is
                available
                on <a href="https://github.com/roxxuz/blue-ml-predict">GitHub</a>.
                We will also use links where you can read a little deeper about different topics, names or special
                concepts, if desired.<br>
                The description is divided into different steps to mimic the steps in which we divided the work.

            <p>
                A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm.
                It is the "thing" that will be used to determine what an image represents,
                and thus also the very heart of the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                When creating a model, we call it "training the model".
                We must teach our model how to calculate what an image represents.
                We do this by training it. <br>We did this with the help of so-called 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a>,
                and more specifically a 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a>.
