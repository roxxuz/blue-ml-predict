                We will try to describe the steps as non-technical as possible.<br>
                For those who are interested in more details or want to see the code itself, the entire project is
                available
                on <a href="https://github.com/roxxuz/blue-ml-predict">GitHub</a>.
                We will also use links where you can read a little deeper about different topics, names or special
                concepts, if desired.<br>
                The description is divided into different steps to mimic the steps in which we divided the work.

                A model represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm.
                It is the "thing" that will be used to determine what an image represents,
                and thus also the very heart of the process.<br>
                Our model is created with the help of so-called 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a>,
                and more specifically a 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we create a model for deep learning, we build up a number of 
                layers where different calculations are made for each layer. 
                There are a variety of settings for each layer. This means there is a lot 
                to test and customize to get the best model possible.<br>
                If a model does not perform as expected, 
                it can often be (but certainly not always) the settings in these layers
                 that needs to be adjusted. It may also be the case that you should 
                 use completely different layers, a different order of the layers 
                 or a different number of layers. As you can see, there are already 
                 many different paths to take here.
